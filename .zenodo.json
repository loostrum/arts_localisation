    "description": "This project contains all necessary tools to localise transient bursts discovered with the Apertif Radio Transient System (ARTS). The localisation uses a chi squared method, comparing the S/N of a detected burst across beams to a model of the telescope response. The beam model includes a simulation of the ARTS tied-array beamformer and the generation of synthesised beams (SBs).",
